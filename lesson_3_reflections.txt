When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be useful when centralized access is needed for colloborating
with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?  Manually pulling changes may be preferrable to having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository because there may be changes to
the remote repository that you don't want automatically added to the local repository or there
might be changes that you want added to the local repository at a particular time.
